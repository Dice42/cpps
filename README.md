## **Modules Overview**

### **Module 00: Basics of C++**
This module serves as an introduction to C++ and covers fundamental concepts:
- **Namespaces**: Organizing code to prevent naming conflicts.
- **Classes & Objects**: Understanding object-oriented programming (OOP) basics.
- **Member Functions**: Defining and using functions within classes.
- **Standard Input/Output Streams**: Working with `std::cout`, `std::cin`, `std::cerr`, etc.
- **Initialization Lists**: Using member initializer lists in constructors.
- **Static Members**: Shared variables and functions across all class instances.
- **Const Keyword**: Read-only variables and functions.

### **Module 01: Memory Allocation**
Focuses on dynamic memory management, including:
- **Heap vs Stack Memory**: Understanding memory storage in C++.
- **`new` and `delete`**: Allocating and deallocating memory.
- **Deep Copy vs Shallow Copy**: Managing object copies effectively.
- **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)**: Automating resource management.

---

### **Module 02: Ad-Hoc Polymorphism and Operator Overloading**
Expands on OOP principles and introduces polymorphism:
- **Function Overloading**: Multiple functions with the same name but different parameters.
- **Operator Overloading**: Customizing operators like `+`, `-`, `[]`, `<<`, `>>`.
- **Orthodox Canonical Form**: Implementing a class with a default constructor, copy constructor, assignment operator, and destructor.

### **Module 03: Inheritance**
Dives into object-oriented inheritance:
- **Base and Derived Classes**: Establishing relationships between classes.
- **Protected Members**: Access control within inheritance.
- **Method Overriding**: Redefining base class methods in derived classes.

---

### **Module 04: Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, and Interfaces**
Explores runtime polymorphism:
- **Virtual Functions**: Enabling dynamic method dispatch.
- **Abstract Classes**: Defining base classes with pure virtual functions.
- **Interfaces**: Implementing multiple inheritance through abstract classes.

---

### **Module 05: Exception Handling and Repetition**
Introduces error handling and control flow:
- **Try, Catch, Throw**: Managing exceptions safely.
- **Custom Exceptions**: Defining user-specific exception classes.
- **Looping Constructs**: Using `for`, `while`, `do-while` efficiently.

---

### **Module 06: C++ Type Casting**
Covers different types of type casting in C++:
- **Static Cast**: Compile-time conversions.
- **Dynamic Cast**: Runtime type identification (RTTI).
- **Const Cast**: Modifying const-qualified variables.
- **Reinterpret Cast**: Low-level type conversion.

---

### **Module 07: C++ Templates**
Introduces generic programming:
- **Function Templates**: Writing generic functions.
- **Class Templates**: Defining template-based classes.
- **Template Specialization**: Customizing behavior for specific data types.

---

### **Module 08: Templated Containers, Iterators, and Algorithms**
Covers advanced template usage:
- **Container Templates**: Implementing custom containers.
- **Iterators**: Using iterators for container traversal.
- **Algorithms**: Implementing sorting, searching, and other STL algorithms.

---

### **Module 09: Standard Template Library (STL)**
Focuses on the powerful STL components:
- **STL Containers**: `vector`, `list`, `map`, `set`, `queue`, etc.
- **STL Iterators**: Bidirectional and random-access iterators.
- **STL Algorithms**: Using built-in algorithms for efficiency.
- **STL Functions & Functors**: Leveraging functional programming in C++.

---

## **Conclusion**
Each module builds upon the previous ones, ensuring a gradual and structured learning experience. By completing this series, you will gain a solid foundation in C++ and be well-prepared for advanced programming challenges.
